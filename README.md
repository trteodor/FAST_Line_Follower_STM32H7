# FAST_Line_Follower_Robot_STM32H7
Hi!
This repository contains all data for my first serious microcontroller project - Line Follower Robot.

This project was created over than 1 years ago, now i decide are to refactor a bit MCU source code and publish the project.

Link to the demo video: 
* **_ ---in november 2021 will be available probably :) _**

* I speak in Polish leanguage on the video.

Detailed description in polish leanguage:

* https://github.com/trteodor/FAST_Line_Follower_STM32H7/blob/master/docs/LF_Desc_PL.pdf

This repository contains all the necessary data needed to build the Robot (Hardware Layer), the source code for the microcontroller, and the source code for the mobile application.

* A lot of things in this project can be done better, but it is done as is :)
